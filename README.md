This is a simple template for creating a FabricMC mod. 
It includes all needed kotlin libraries, semi automatic fabric.mod.json generation, and modrinth publishing.

Change your values in `gradle.properties` and you're good to go!<br>
Don't forget to change your package namespace and the project name in `settings.gradle.kts` and your mod id inside the `resource` folder!
